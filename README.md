# Mechanical Characterization of Asbestos-free Nanocomposites using ML Optimization.

The machine learning models (Random Forest, Linear Regression, Logistic Regression) to optimize asbestos-free polymer nanocomposites. Analyze key features affecting tensile and compression strength. Identify crucial factors and suggest optimal compositions, integrating material science insights for iterative improvement and clear documentation.

## Project Structure

• app.py: The main Python script where the machine learning models are implemented and executed.

• data/: A directory containing datasets used for training and evaluation.

• models/: Directory where trained models and related files are stored.

• notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model experimentation.

• results/: Directory for storing the results, including plots, model performance metrics, and reports.



## Features

• Data Analysis: In-depth analysis of key features affecting the mechanical properties of nanocomposites.

• Modeling: Implementation of Random Forest, Linear Regression, and Logistic Regression to predict tensile and compression strength.

• Feature Importance: Identification of crucial factors influencing material strength.

• Optimization: Suggests optimal material compositions based on model predictions.

• Integration with Material Science: Combines machine learning with material science insights for more accurate predictions.
